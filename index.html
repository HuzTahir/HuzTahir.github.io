    <h1> Huzaifa Tahir's Portal</h1>
    <h2> About Me: </h2>
    <p> As a computer science student at Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC), I am passionate about web and game development, graphic design, and data science. I am pursuing my BS degree in computer science, which I expect to complete in November 2026.

I have a strong educational background in programming, with previous studies at National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) and FFC Grammar School, Pakistan. I have also earned multiple certifications from Coursera and DigiSkills.pk, covering topics such as game development with Scratch, HTML and CSS, and freelancing.

I have developed two game projects with SFML, a cross-platform multimedia library for C++. I have also mastered HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and created dynamic web applications with responsive design and user interactivity. Additionally, I have expertise in data science and AI, using Python to manipulate and analyze data and create innovative solutions.

I am eager to collaborate and learn from other programmers in the tech community, and to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and opportunities. I am always open to connect or discuss potential projects or opportunities at huztahir@gmail.com.</p>
